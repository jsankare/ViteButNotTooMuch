        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Small daily actions lead to real progress. We believe in the power of 
          consistent, manageable steps rather than unsustainable bursts of activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Move fast, but don&apos;t burn out. This balance is key to long-term success 
          and sustainable personal growth.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Each day, you&apos;re presented with a micro-challenge. These challenges are 
          designed to be completed in 5-15 minutes, making them accessible regardless 
          of your schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Categories span across mind, wellness, and learning - because holistic 
          growth comes from diverse experiences.

        <h2>Why Micro-Challenges?</h2>
        <p>
          Big goals can be overwhelming. Breaking them down into small, daily 
          actions makes progress manageable and sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our micro-challenges help you build momentum while avoiding burnout. 
          It&apos;s about finding the sweet spot between progress and sustainability.
